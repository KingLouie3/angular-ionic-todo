# Angular TODO App Conversion to Ionic

In this repository you are given a working Angular TODO Application. In this challenge your goal as a team is to create a new application in Ionic 4 that has the same functionality but using Ionic's pre-built components. Learning goals of the project is to be more comfortable with ionic components, documenation and learn how to work on a shared git repository with another person. 

See [Ionic 4 Docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs) for some more ideas. Some students use Ionic Cards, List, Checkbox and input. 


## Setup 
This is mean to be a pair project. Decide which person will create a repository on their github and add the other user. To add a user to **settings** >> **collaborators and teams** then add the user in the input field.

## Requirements
1. App must have a login and register page
2. A user must be able to add todos
3. A user must be able to view added todos
4. A user should be able to remove a todo.

**HINT** You can use the existing logic from the application. Commit your work often!

### WorkFlow
In this pair project you and another person will work on the same repository on the **master branch**. After completing a part of the app you want to share with your partern you will need to **commit** your work and **push**. The other user will then need to **pull** the work. 

**NOTE** IF you both touch the same files you will get a merge conflict and will have to resolve that.
